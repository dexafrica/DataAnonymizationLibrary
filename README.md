# Data Anonymization Library

The library consists of implementations of some data anonymization algorithms in c#.

Generalization based algorithms:
- K-Mondrian
- Mpalm

Permutation based algorithms:
- Bucketization
- One-Attribute-Per-Column-Slicing

Permutation Combined with Generalization 

Example usage:
